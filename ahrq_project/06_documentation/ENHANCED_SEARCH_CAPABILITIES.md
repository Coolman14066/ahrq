# Enhanced AHRQ Compendium Search Capabilities

## Executive Summary

This document details the comprehensive analysis of Scopus API capabilities for searching AHRQ Compendium citations, including newly discovered search fields, advanced operators, and optimized search strategies based on citation pattern analysis.

## 1. Newly Discovered Scopus API Capabilities

### 1.1 Advanced Search Fields

#### INDEXTERMS Field
- **Purpose**: Searches controlled vocabulary/indexed terms assigned by Scopus
- **Advantage**: Higher precision than keyword searches
- **Example**: `INDEXTERMS("health systems") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY(AHRQ)`

#### EXACTSRCTITLE Field
- **Purpose**: Exact journal title matching (vs. partial with SRCTITLE)
- **Advantage**: Eliminates false positives from similar journal names
- **Example**: `EXACTSRCTITLE("Health Affairs") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY(AHRQ)`

#### Reference-Specific Fields
- **REFAUTH**: Search within cited authors
- **REFSRCTITLE**: Search within cited source titles
- **REF**: Combined reference field
- **Example**: `REFAUTH("Contreary K") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY("health system*")`

### 1.2 Advanced Proximity Operators

#### PRE/n (Ordered Proximity)
- **Function**: First term must precede second by n words
- **Advantage**: More precise than W/n for directional relationships
- **Example**: `AHRQ PRE/5 Compendium` (AHRQ appears before Compendium)

#### Nested Proximity
- **Capability**: Can combine with OR (but not AND)
- **Example**: `(AHRQ OR "Agency for Healthcare") W/5 Compendium`

### 1.3 Date Operators
- **PUBYEAR AFTER/BEFORE**: Alternative to > and < operators
- **Example**: `PUBYEAR AFTER 2020 AND PUBYEAR BEFORE 2024`

## 3. Enhanced Search Strategies

### 3.1 Tier 1: Precision-Focused Direct Searches
```
TITLE-ABS-KEY(
  ("AHRQ Compendium of U.S. Health Systems") OR 
  ("AHRQ Compendium of US Health Systems") OR 
  ("AHRQ Compendium" AND "Hospital Linkage File") OR
  ("2018 AHRQ Compendium" OR "2019 AHRQ Compendium" OR 
   "2020 AHRQ Compendium" OR "2021 AHRQ Compendium" OR 
   "2022 AHRQ Compendium" OR "2023 AHRQ Compendium")
)
```

### 3.2 Tier 2: Ordered Proximity Searches
```
TITLE-ABS-KEY(
  (AHRQ PRE/5 Compendium) OR 
  ("Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality" PRE/10 Compendium) OR
  (AHRQ PRE/3 "Hospital Linkage")
)
```

### 3.3 Tier 3: Citation Network Searches
```
REF(
  ("Contreary" AND "Health Affairs" AND "2021") OR 
  ("Consolidation and Mergers among Health Systems") OR
  ("Furukawa" AND AHRQ AND "2020")
)
```

### 3.4 Tier 4: Usage Context Searches
```
TITLE-ABS-KEY(
  ("hospital system affiliation" OR "system linkage" OR 
   "health system definition") AND 
  (AHRQ OR "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality")
)
```

### 3.5 Tier 5: Controlled Vocabulary Searches
```
INDEXTERMS("health systems" OR "hospital systems") AND 
TITLE-ABS-KEY(AHRQ AND (compendium OR "linkage file"))
```

## 4. Exclusion Refinements

To reduce false positives, exclude:
- `"AHRQ quality indicators"`
- `"AHRQ patient safety indicators"`
- `"AHRQ prevention quality indicators"`
- `"AHRQ Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project"`

## 5. Search Effectiveness Analysis

### Current Performance (25 unique articles found):
- **Most Effective**: Reference searches (52% of results)
- **Moderately Effective**: Direct searches (32% of results)
- **Least Effective**: Broad contextual searches (16% of results)

### Expected Improvements with Enhanced Strategies:
- **Year-specific searches**: +15-20 additional articles
- **Hospital Linkage File**: +10-15 additional articles
- **Ordered proximity (PRE/n)**: +5-10 additional articles
- **INDEXTERMS**: Higher precision, fewer false positives

## 6. Implementation Recommendations

### 6.1 Immediate Actions
1. Update search_config.json with enhanced search tiers
2. Implement year-specific search variants (2018-2023)
3. Add "Hospital Linkage File" variations
4. Deploy PRE/n proximity operators

### 6.2 Testing Protocol
1. Run test_enhanced_search.py to validate new operators
2. Compare results with current baseline
3. Analyze precision/recall metrics
4. Adjust exclusion terms based on false positives

### 6.3 Monitoring and Optimization
1. Track which search tiers yield highest relevance scores
2. Monitor for new year-specific mentions (2024+)
3. Update key paper citations quarterly
4. Refine INDEXTERMS based on Scopus vocabulary updates

## 7. Advanced Capabilities Not Yet Implemented

### 7.1 Limited Value for AHRQ Searches
- **CASREGNUMBER**: Chemical registry numbers (not applicable)
- **CODEN**: Journal codes (less precise than EXACTSRCTITLE)
- **LANGUAGE**: Most AHRQ citations are in English

### 7.2 API Limitations
- Cannot extract full reference lists for co-citation analysis
- Limited to searching what cites a paper, not what a paper cites
- Maximum 5,000 results per query without cursor pagination

## 8. Conclusion

The enhanced search strategies leverage advanced Scopus API capabilities to significantly improve AHRQ Compendium citation discovery. Key improvements include:

1. **Year-specific targeting** captures temporal variations
2. **Ordered proximity** (PRE/n) improves precision
3. **Hospital Linkage File** variants capture additional uses
4. **INDEXTERMS** provides controlled vocabulary precision
5. **Citation network searches** find indirect references

These enhancements are expected to increase citation discovery by 40-60% while maintaining or improving precision through targeted exclusions and field-specific searches.
