Differences were assessed in four dimensions: (1) analytics-oriented digital technologies (AODT), (2) customer-oriented digital technologies (CODT), (3) growth and innovation–oriented digital technologies (GODT), and (4) futuristic and experimental digital technologies (FEDT). The former two dimensions are foundational to health systems’ digital orientation, whereas the latter two will prepare for future disruptions.\n          \n          \n            Methods\n            We surveyed a robust group of health system chief executive officers (CEOs) across the United States from February to March 2021. Among the 625 CEOs, 135 (22%) responded to our survey. We considered the above four broad digital technology orientations, which were ratified with expert consensus. Secondary data were collected from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Hospital Compendium, leading to a matched usable dataset of 124 health systems for analysis.

The ordered logistic estimation results provided nuanced insights. Medium-sized (P&lt;.001) health systems, major teaching health systems (P&lt;.001), and systems with high-burden hospitals (P&lt;.001) appear to be doing worse with respect to AODT orientations, raising some concerns. Health systems of medium (P&lt;.001) and large (P=.02) sizes, major teaching health systems (P=.07), those with a high revenue (P=.05), and systems with high-burden hospitals (P&lt;.001) have less CODT orientation. Health systems in the midwest (P=.05) and southern (P=.04) states are more likely to adopt GODT, whereas high-revenue (P=.004) and investor-ownership (P=.01) health systems are deterred from GODT. Health systems of a medium size, and those that are in the midwest (P&lt;.001), south (P&lt;.001), and west (P=.01) are more adept to FEDT, whereas medium (P&lt;.001) and high-revenue (P&lt;.001) health systems, and those with a high discharge rate (P=.04) or high burden (P=.003, P=.005) have subdued FEDT orientations.\n          \n          \n            Conclusions\n            Almost all health systems have some current foundational digital technological orientations to glean intelligence or service delivery to customers, with some notable exceptions.

      "abstract": "Background: Physician-hospital vertical integration is gaining steam but it is unclear how they affect hospital output. Objective: To examine the direct impact of vertical integration on hospital output. Design: A pooled design with 6-year data using linear regressions was used. Then, panel data design with hospital fixed effects was used. Methods: We linked American Hospital Association data (2016-2021) with AHRQ Comparative Health System Performance Initiative’s Compendium (2018, 2020, 2021; 34 987 hospital-year observations) to develop new measures of vertical integration and assess its relationship with several measures of hospital output including annualized total admissions, total number of inpatients days, and total number of emergency department (ED) and outpatient visits. Results: We find that a hospital’s entry into a vertical integration has little or no impact on a broad set of metrics capturing hospital output. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that vertical integrations as currently structured may not yield meaningful gains in output or productivity and hospitals faced with declining productivity need to carefully consider the expected gains from vertical integration strategies.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic, with all its virus variants, remains a serious situation. Health systems across the United States are trying their best to respond. On average, the health care workforce is relatively homogenous, even though it cares for a highly diverse array of patients. This perennial problem in the US health care workforce has only been accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical workers should reflect on the variety of patients they care for and strive to understand their mindsets within the larger contexts of culture, gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and socioeconomic realities. Along with talent and skills, diversity and inclusion (D&I) are essential for maintaining a workforce that can treat the myriad needs and populations that health systems serve. Developing hiring strategies that will help achieve greater workforce diversity remains a challenge for health system leaders.\n            ObjectiveThe primary aims of this study were to: (1) explore the characteristics of US health systems and their associations with D&I practices and benefits, (2) examine the associations between D&I practices and three pathways to equip workforces, and (3) examine the associations between the three pathways to better equip workforces and business and service benefits. The three pathways are: (1) improving D&I among existing employees (IMPROVE), (2) using multiple channels to find and recruit the workforce (RECRUIT), and (3) collaborating with universities to find new talent and establish plans to train students (COLLABORATE).\n            MethodsDuring February to March 2021, 625 health systems in the United States were surveyed with the help of a consultant, 135 (21.6%) of whom responded.

We then examined the relationships among diversity practices, pathways, and benefits.\n            ResultsHealth system characteristics such as size, location, ownership, teaching, and revenue have varying associations with diversity practices and outcomes. D&I and talent strategies exhibited different associations with the three workforce pathways. Regarding the mediating effects, the IMPROVE pathway seems to be more effective than the RECRUIT and COLLABORATE pathways, enabling the diversity strategy to prompt business or service benefits.

      "abstract": "BackgroundHow do health systems in the United States view the concept of merger and acquisition (M&A) in a post-COVID 19 “new normal”? How do new entrants to the market and incumbents influence horizontal and vertical integration of health systems? Traditionally, it has been argued that M&A activity is designed to reduce inequities in the market, shift toward value-based care, or enhance the number and quality of health care offerings in a given market. However, the recent history of M&A activity has yielded fewer noble results. As might be expected, the smaller the geographical region in which M&A activity is pursued, the higher the likelihood that monopolistic tendencies will result.\n            ObjectiveWe focused on three types of competition perceptions, external environment uncertainty–related competition, technology disruption–driven competition, and customer service–driven competition, and two integration plans, vertical integration and horizontal integration. We examined (1) how health system characteristics help discern competition perceptions and integration decisions, and (2) how environment-, technology-, and service-driven competition aspects influence vertical and horizontal integration among US health systems in the post-COVID-19 new normal.\n            MethodsWe used data for this study collected through a consultant from a robust group of health system chief executive officers (CEOs) across the United States from February to March 2021. Among the 625 CEOs, 135 (21.6%) responded to our survey. We considered competition and integration aspects from the literature and ratified them via expert consensus. We collected secondary data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Compendium of the US Health Systems, leading to a matched data set for 124 health systems. We used inferential statistical comparisons to assess differences across health systems regarding competition and integration, and we used ordered logit estimations to relate competition and integration.\n            ResultsHealth systems generally have a high level of the four types of competition perceptions, with the greatest concern being technology disruption–driven competition rather than environment uncertainty–related competition and customer service–driven competition. The first set of estimation results showed that size, teaching status, revenue, and uncompensated care burden are the main contingent factors influencing the three competition perceptions. The second set of estimation results revealed the relationships between different competition perceptions and integration plans. For vertical integration, environment uncertainty–related competition had a significant positive influence (P<.001), while the influence of technology disruption–driven competition was significant but negative (P<.001). The influence of customer service–driven competition on vertical integration was not evident. For horizontal integration, the results were similar for environment uncertainty–related competition and technology disruption–driven competition; however, the significance of technology disruption–driven competition was weak (P=.05). The influence of customer service–driven competition in the combined model was significant and negative (P<.001).\n            ConclusionsCompetition-driven integration has subtle influences across health systems. Environment uncertainty–related competition is a significant factor, with underlying contingent factors such as revenue concerns and leadership as the leading causes of integration plans. However, technology disruption may hinder integrations. Undoubtedly, small- and low-revenue health systems facing a high level of competition are likely to merge to navigate the health care business successfully. This trend should be a focus of policy to avoid monopolistic markets",

The first set of estimation results showed that size, teaching status, revenue, and uncompensated care burden are the main contingent factors influencing the three competition perceptions. The second set of estimation results revealed the relationships between different competition perceptions and integration plans. For vertical integration, environment uncertainty–related competition had a significant positive influence (P<.001), while the influence of technology disruption–driven competition was significant but negative (P<.001). The influence of customer service–driven competition on vertical integration was not evident. For horizontal integration, the results were similar for environment uncertainty–related competition and technology disruption–driven competition; however, the significance of technology disruption–driven competition was weak (P=.05). The influence of customer service–driven competition in the combined model was significant and negative (P<.001). Conclusions Competition-driven integration has subtle influences across health systems. Environment uncertainty–related competition is a significant factor, with underlying contingent factors such as revenue concerns and leadership as the leading causes of integration plans. However, technology disruption may hinder integrations. Undoubtedly, small- and low-revenue health systems facing a high level of competition are likely to merge to navigate the health care business successfully. This trend should be a focus of policy to avoid monopolistic markets.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective To characterize racial differences in receipt of low value care (services that provide little to no benefit yet have potential for harm) among older Medicare beneficiaries overall and within health systems in the United States. Design Retrospective cohort study Setting 100% Medicare fee-for-service administrative data (2016–18). Participants Black and White Medicare patients aged 65 or older as of 2016 and attributed to 595 health systems in the United States. Main outcome measures Receipt of 40 low value services among Black and White patients, with and without adjustment for patient age, sex, and previous healthcare use. Additional models included health system fixed effects to assess racial differences within health systems and separately, racial composition of the health system’s population to assess the relative contributions of individual patient race and health system racial composition to low value care receipt. Results The cohort included 9 833 304 patients (6.8% Black; 57.9% female). Of 40 low value services examined, Black patients had higher adjusted receipt of nine services and lower receipt of 20 services than White patients. Specifically, Black patients were more likely to receive low value acute diagnostic tests, including imaging for uncomplicated headache (6.9% v 3.2%) and head computed tomography scans for dizziness (3.1% v 1.9%). White patients had higher rates of low value screening tests and treatments, including preoperative laboratory tests (10.3% v 6.5%), prostate specific antigen tests (31.0% v 25.7%), and antibiotics for upper respiratory infections (36.6% v 32.7%; all P<0.001). Secondary analyses showed that these differences persisted within given health systems and were not explained by Black and White patients receiving care from different systems. Conclusions Black patients were more likely to receive low value acute diagnostic tests and White patients were more likely to receive low value screening tests and treatments. Differences were generally small and were largely due to differential care within health systems. These patterns suggest potential individual, interpersonal, and structural factors that researchers, policy makers, and health system leaders might investigate and address to improve care quality and equity.",

      "abstract": "Surgical proctoring requires increasing resources in growing healthcare systems. In addition, travel has become less safe in the era of COVID-19. This study demonstrates surgeon satisfaction and safety with tele-proctoring in robotic gynecologic surgery. This pilot study assesses surgeon satisfaction and operative outcomes with a novel operative tele-proctoring system with a continuous two-way video-audio feed that allows the off-site surgeon to see the operating room, surgical field, and hands of the robotic surgeon. After thorough system testing, two experienced surgeons underwent tele-proctoring for hospital credentialing, completing 7 total cases. Each completed pre- and post-surveys developed from the Michigan Standard Simulation Experience Scale. Surgical characteristics were compared between tele-proctored cases and 59 historical cases proctored in-person over the last 8 years. Surgeons reported unanimous high satisfaction with tele-proctoring (5 ± 0). There were no major technologic issues. Five of the tele-proctored cases and 35 of controls were hysterectomies. Mean age was 48.2 ± 1.4 years, mean BMI was 29.6 ± 0.9 kg/m2, and mean uterine weight was 152 ± 112.3 g. Two-thirds had prior abdominal surgery (P > 0.1). Tele-proctored hysterectomies were 58 ± 6.5 min shorter than controls (P = 0.001). There were no differences in EBL or complication rates (P > 0.1). Tele-proctoring resulted in high surgeon satisfaction rates with no difference in EBL or complications. Tele-mentoring is a natural extension of tele-proctoring that could provide advanced surgical expertise far beyond where we can physically reach.",

      "abstract": "Abstract INTRODUCTION As the complexity of medical treatments and patient care systems have increased, the concept of patient navigation is growing in both popularity and breadth of application. Patient navigators are trained personnel whose role is not to provide clinical care, but to partner with patients to help them identify their needs and goals and then overcome modifiable patient‐, provider‐, and systems‐level barriers. Due to its high incidence, duration, and medical–social complexity, dementia is an ideal candidate for a patient‐centric health care delivery model such as care navigation. METHODS The Alzheimer's Association formed an expert workgroup of researchers in the field of dementia care navigation to identify evidence‐based guidelines. RESULTS Recognizing the unique and challenging needs of persons living with dementia and their care partners, several U.S. dementia care navigation programs have been developed and assessed in recent years. Collectively these programs demonstrate that persons living with dementia and their care partners benefit from dementia care navigation. Improved care system outcomes for the person living with dementia include reduced emergency department visits, lower hospital readmissions, fewer days hospitalized, and shorter delays in long‐term care placement. Well‐being is also increased, as there is decreased depression, illness, strain, embarrassment, and behavioral symptoms and increased self‐reported quality of life. For care partners, dementia navigation resulted in decreased depression, burden, and unmet needs. DISCUSSION This article presents principles of dementia care navigation to inform existing and emerging dementia care navigation programs. Highlights Several U.S. dementia care navigation programs have demonstrated outcomes for persons living with dementia, care partners, and health systems. The Alzheimer's Association formed an expert workgroup of researchers in the field of dementia care navigation to create a shared definition and identify evidence‐based guidelines or principles. These outlined principles of dementia care navigation can inform existing and emerging dementia care navigation programs",

      "abstract": "Prospective patients are increasingly going to health systems’ online directories to find their next primary care providers (PCP), making this channel of communication important to assess to determine if it is meeting patients’ needs. When seeking a new PCP, patients want to know not only educational credentials but also providers’ communication traits, and personal information to showcase providers as real people. Offering this information, to help patients find providers best suited to meet their needs, is a key attribute of patient-centered care. To analyze whether health systems’ online PCP biographies are including the information prospective patients deem important when selecting a PCP. Using the AHRQ’s Compendium of US Health Systems, 523 health systems’ PCP biographies were content analyzed (n = 5004 biographies) from December 2019 to March 2020. Forty-eight unique pieces of information were coded for either their presence or absence (e.g., education, photo, languages spoken, insurance accepted, patient reviews, philosophy of care, video provided, personal hobbies/interests). Providers’ alphabetic credentials (e.g., MD, DO, APRN) were also documented. The majority of biographies stated the provider’s medical education (83.6%) and included a photo (81.4%). However, information patients also desire (e.g., communication traits and personal information) were less prevalent. Only 33.7% listed languages spoken, 18.2% offered patient reviews, 14.4% had personal hobbies/interests, and 10.6% included a video. There were also 192 unique alphabetic credential combinations listed next to providers’ names. Two health systems clearly included information within biographies to help prospective patients understand what these credentials meant. Health systems could make simple changes to their providers’ online biographies in order to help patients make more informed decisions of PCPs. Doing so may decrease doctor shopping, and also lead to a greater likelihood of developing longer-term relationships with PCPs.",

      "abstract": "Policy Points Antitrust enforcement has been too narrowly focused on predicting postmerger market share and not enough on the likely impact of mergers and acquisitions on production efficiency and quality. Care delivery redesign is a term that captures various innovations and changes in the organization and delivery of health care, which may lead to increased production efficiency and improved quality of care. Regulators and policymakers can use the framework to develop empirical measures to assist in understanding changes in production processes as well as in resultant outcomes. Significant opportunities exist to improve data collection and require reporting to better assist regulators with antitrust enforcement and help policymakers create effective legislation. Examples include improving compliance with required hospital and insurer transaction price data reporting, growing the availability of all-payer claims databases, improving existing Medicare cost reporting, and achieving consensus on quality measures that are best used to measure the impact of consolidation. There is a fundamental need to systematically track health care organizations and their affiliations and component parts (e.g., hospitals, physician practices, skilled nursing facilities, etc.) longitudinally, especially as organizations expand across markets and state boundaries and are owned by various entities, including private equity.",

      "abstract": "ImportanceHealth systems play a central role in the delivery of health care, but relatively little is known about these organizations and their performance.ObjectiveTo (1) identify and describe health systems in the United States; (2) assess differences between physicians and hospitals in and outside of health systems; and (3) compare quality and cost of care delivered by physicians and hospitals in and outside of health systems.Evidence ReviewHealth systems were defined as groups of commonly owned or managed entities that included at least 1 general acute care hospital, 10 primary care physicians, and 50 total physicians located within a single hospital referral region. They were identified using Centers for Medicare &amp;amp;amp; Medicaid Services administrative data, Internal Revenue Service filings, Medicare and commercial claims, and other data. Health systems were categorized as academic, public, large for-profit, large nonprofit, or other private systems. Quality of preventive care, chronic disease management, patient experience, low-value care, mortality, hospital readmissions, and spending were assessed for Medicare beneficiaries attributed to system and nonsystem physicians. Prices for physician and hospital services and total spending were assessed in 2018 commercial claims data. Outcomes were adjusted for patient characteristics and geographic area.FindingsA total of 580 health systems were identified and varied greatly in size. Systems accounted for 40% of physicians and 84% of general acute care hospital beds and delivered primary care to 41% of traditional Medicare beneficiaries. Academic and large nonprofit systems accounted for a majority of system physicians (80%) and system hospital beds (64%). System hospitals were larger than nonsystem hospitals (67% vs 23% with &amp;amp;gt;100 beds), as were system physician practices (74% vs 12% with &amp;amp;gt;100 physicians). Performance on measures of preventive care, clinical quality, and patient experience was modestly higher for health system physicians and hospitals than for nonsystem physicians and hospitals. Prices paid to health system physicians and hospitals were significantly higher than prices paid to nonsystem physicians and hospitals (12%-26% higher for physician services, 31% for hospital services). Adjusting for practice size attenuated health systems differences on quality measures, but price differences for small and medium practices remained large.Conclusions and RelevanceIn 2018, health system physicians and hospitals delivered a large portion of medical services. Performance on clinical quality and patient experience measures was marginally better in systems but spending and prices were substantially higher. This was especially true for small practices. Small quality differentials combined with large price differentials suggests that health systems have not, on average, realized their potential for better care at equal or lower cost.</jats:sec",

      "abstract": "ImportanceHospital participation in bundled payment initiatives has been associated with financial savings and stable quality of care. However, how physician group practices (PGPs) perform in bundled payments compared with hospitals remains unknown.ObjectivesTo evaluate the association of PGP participation in the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative with episode outcomes and to compare these with outcomes for participating hospitals.Design, Settings, and ParticipantsThis cohort study with a difference-in-differences analysis used 2011 to 2018 Medicare claims data to compare the association of BPCI participation with episode outcomes for PGPs vs hospitals providing medical and surgical care to Medicare beneficiaries. Data analyses were conducted from January 1, 2020, to May 31, 2022.ExposuresHospitalization for any of the 10 highest-volume episodes (5 medical and 5 surgical) included in the BPCI initiative for Medicare patients of participating PGPs and hospitals.Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was 90-day total episode spending. Secondary outcomes were 90-day readmissions and mortality.ResultsThe total sample comprised data from 1 288 781 Medicare beneficiaries, of whom 696 710 (mean [SD] age, 76.2 [10.8] years; 432 429 [59.7%] women; 619 655 [85.5%] White individuals) received care through 379 BPCI-participating hospitals and 1441 propensity-matched non−BPCI-participating hospitals, and 592 071 (mean [SD] age, 75.4 [10.9] years; 527 574 [86.6%] women; 360 835 [59.3%] White individuals) received care from 6405 physicians in BPCI-participating PGPs and 24 758 propensity-matched physicians in non−BPCI-participating PGPs. For PGPs, BPCI participation was associated with greater reductions in episode spending for surgical (difference, –$1368; 95% CI, –$1648 to –$1088) but not for medical episodes (difference, –$101; 95% CI, –$410 to $206). Hospital participation in BPCI was associated with greater reductions in episode spending for both surgical (–$1010; 95% CI, –$1345 to –$675) and medical (–$763; 95% CI, –$1139 to –$386) episodes.Conclusions and RelevanceThis cohort study and difference-in-differences analysis of PGPs and hospital participation in BPCI found that bundled payments were associated with cost savings for surgical episodes for PGPs, and savings for both surgical and medical episodes for hospitals. Policy makers should consider the comparative performance of participant types when designing and evaluating bundled payment models.</jats:sec",

      "abstract": "Background Regulations put in place to protect the privacy of individuals receiving substance use disorder (SUD) treatment have resulted in an unintended consequence of siloed SUD treatment and referral information outside of the integrated electronic health record (EHR). Recent revisions to these regulations have opened the door to data integration, which creates opportunities for enhanced patient care and more efficient workflows. We report on the experience of one safety-net hospital system integrating SUD treatment data into the EHR. Methods SUD treatment and referral information was integrated from siloed systems into the EHR through the implementation of a referral order, treatment episode definition, and referral and episode-related tools for addiction therapists and other clinicians. Integration was evaluated by monitoring SUD treatment episode characteristics, patient characteristics, referral linkage, and treatment episode retention before and after integration. Satisfaction of end-users with the new tools was evaluated through a survey of addiction therapists. Results After integration, three more SUD treatment programs were represented in the EHR. This increased the number of patients that could be tracked as initiating SUD treatment by 250%, from 562 before to 1,411 after integration. After integration, overall referral linkage declined (74% vs. 48%) and treatment episode retention at 90-days was higher (45% vs. 74%). Addiction therapists appreciated the efficiency of having all SUD treatment information in the EHR but did not find that the tools provided a large time savings shortly after integration. Conclusions Integration of SUD treatment program data into the EHR facilitated both care coordination in patient treatment and quality improvement initiatives for treatment programs. Referral linkage and retention rates were likely modified by a broader capture of patients and changed outcome definition criteria. Greater preparatory workflow analysis may decrease initial end-user burden. Integration of siloed data, made possible given revised regulations, is essential to an efficient hub-and-spoke model of care, which must standardize and coordinate patient care across multiple clinics and departments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective To test the effect of hospital‐physician integration on primary care physicians' (PCP) clinical volume in traditional Medicare. Data Sources and Study Setting Nationwide retrospective longitudinal study using Medicare claims and other data sources from 2010 to 2016. Study Design We identified 70,000 PCPs, some of whom remained non‐integrated and some who became hospital‐integrated during this study period. We used an event study design to identify the effect of integration on key measures of physicians' clinical volume, including the number of claims, work‐relative value units (RVUs), professional revenue generated, number of patients treated, and facility fee revenue generated. Principal Findings Per‐physician clinical volume declined by statistically and economically significant margins. Relative to the comparison group who remained non‐integrated, work RVUs fell by 7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: −8.6% to −5.5%); the number of patients treated fell by 4% (95% CI: −5.8% to −2.6%); and claims volume among PCPs who became hospital‐integrated fell by over 15% (95% CI: −16.8% to −13.5%). Though professional revenue declined by $29,165 (95% CI: −$32,286 to −$26,044), this loss was almost entirely offset by increased facility fee revenue of $28,556 (95% CI: 26,909 to 30,203). Conclusions Hospital‐physician integration may affect the quantity of clinical services delivered by PCPs to traditional Medicare beneficiaries. Reductions in clinical volume associated with integration may have long‐term consequences for the supply of physician services and patient access to primary care. Future research on physician time use and patient access following hospital integration would further add to the evidence base.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundBig data from large, government-sponsored surveys and data sets offers researchers opportunities to conduct population-based studies of important health issues in the United States, as well as develop preliminary data to support proposed future work. Yet, navigating these national data sources is challenging. Despite the widespread availability of national data, there is little guidance for researchers on how to access and evaluate the use of these resources.\n            ObjectiveOur aim was to identify and summarize a comprehensive list of federally sponsored, health- and health care–related data sources that are accessible in the public domain in order to facilitate their use by researchers.\n            MethodsWe conducted a systematic mapping review of government sources of health-related data on US populations and with active or recent (previous 10 years) data collection. The key measures were government sponsor, overview and purpose of data, population of interest, sampling design, sample size, data collection methodology, type and description of data, and cost to obtain data.

      "abstract": "Background Big data from large, government-sponsored surveys and data sets offers researchers opportunities to conduct population-based studies of important health issues in the United States, as well as develop preliminary data to support proposed future work. Yet, navigating these national data sources is challenging. Despite the widespread availability of national data, there is little guidance for researchers on how to access and evaluate the use of these resources. Objective Our aim was to identify and summarize a comprehensive list of federally sponsored, health- and health care–related data sources that are accessible in the public domain in order to facilitate their use by researchers. Methods We conducted a systematic mapping review of government sources of health-related data on US populations and with active or recent (previous 10 years) data collection. The key measures were government sponsor, overview and purpose of data, population of interest, sampling design, sample size, data collection methodology, type and description of data, and cost to obtain data. Convergent synthesis was used to aggregate findings. Results Among 106 unique data sources, 57 met the inclusion criteria. Data sources were classified as survey or assessment data (n=30, 53%), trends data (n=27, 47%), summative processed data (n=27, 47%), primary registry data (n=17, 30%), and evaluative data (n=11, 19%).

Findings In this cross-sectional study of 38 501 infants, variation in mortality across health systems was 1.5% of the total variance and 5.2% for length of stay among surviving infants. However, the 2–percentage point difference in mortality among systems in the highest and lowest performing quartiles and 12-day difference in length of stay among surviving infants were potentially clinically meaningful. Meaning These findings suggest that opportunities for health systems to improve quality exist, thereby decreasing mortality and length of stay for very preterm infants.",

      "abstract": "Background Little is known about hospital pricing for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Using new price transparency data, we assessed variation in CABG prices across US hospitals and the association between higher prices and hospital characteristics, including quality of care. Methods and Results Prices for diagnosis related group code 236 were obtained from the Turquoise database and linked by Medicare Facility ID to publicly available hospital characteristics. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to assess factors predictive of higher prices. Across 544 hospitals, median commercial and self‐pay rates were 2.01 and 2.64 times the Medicare rate ($57 240 and $75 047, respectively, versus $28 398). Within hospitals, the 90th percentile insurer‐negotiated price was 1.83 times the 10th percentile price. Across hospitals, the 90th percentile commercial rate was 2.91 times the 10th percentile hospital rate. Regional median hospital prices ranged from $35 624 in the East South Central to $84 080 in the Pacific. In univariate analysis, higher inpatient revenue, greater annual discharges, and major teaching status were significantly associated with higher prices. In multivariable analysis, major teaching and investor‐owned status were associated with significantly higher prices (+$8653 and +$12 200, respectively). CABG prices were not related to death, readmissions, patient ratings, or overall Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services hospital rating. Conclusions There is significant variation in CABG pricing, with certain characteristics associated with higher rates, including major teaching status and investor ownership. Notably, higher CABG prices were not associated with better‐quality care, suggesting a need for further investigation into drivers of pricing variation and the implications for health care spending and access.",

      "abstract": ": The COVID-19 pandemic placed intense pressure on individual hospitals and hospital systems. While no hospital could have predicted the exact needs required to respond to the crisis, there may be certain organizational characteristics or hospital system types that were better prepared to respond effectively. In this article, we propose a conceptual model for effectiveness of health system organizational response to COVID-19, using the theoretical foundation of organizational slack which is defined as the “excess” accumulated resources that do not contribute to that organization’s immediate production function. We first define and describe the contributors of organizational slack, such as accumulated social capital or financial health. We then describe the benefits of organizational slack such as the ability to be more innovative or having more operational flexibility. Next, we discuss the application of organizational slack during the pandemic to adapt operations, redeploy staff and/or supplies and to manage any technological pivots (e.g., the rapid escalation of telehealth). Finally, we address the ways that hospital system structures may moderate the relationship between the benefits and applications of organizational slack. The COVID-19 pandemic placed unique pressures on hospitals as the crisis was sustained and will most likely transform future operations and care delivery. Through the lens of organizational slack, we can better understand the optimal ways to respond to future crises.",

      "abstract": "Background: Medicare's accountable care organizations (ACOs)-designed to improve quality and lower spending-were associated with growing savings in previous studies. However, savings estimates may be biased by beneficiary sorting among providers based on healthcare needs and by providers opting into the program based on anticipated gains.\r\n\r\nMethods: Using Medicare administrative claims (2009-2014), we compared annual spending changes after provider organizations joined ACOs to changes in non-ACOs (controls). To address provider selection, using novel data to identify non-ACO organizations, we restricted controls to comparably large provider organizations. To address beneficiary selection, we (a) estimated within-organization (including non-ACO comparison organizations) spending changes, (b) estimated within-beneficiary spending changes, (c) incorporated beneficiaries without qualifying healthcare expenses, and (d) used a fixed beneficiary ACO assignment using the pre-ACO period.\r\n\r\nResults: Each year, 19% of Medicare beneficiaries switched provider organizations. Spending was higher for switchers than stayers ($3163, p < .001) and grew more the next year ($2004; p < .001). Starting from a baseline regression modeled on previous ACO evaluations, estimated savings varied widely as we sequentially introduced methods to address selection. Combining methods, however, generated more stable estimated ACO savings of $46 (p = .022), averaged across cohorts.\r\n\r\nConclusions: When implementing a comprehensive suite of methods to adjust for provider and beneficiary selection, we estimated ACO savings that grew over time. Our estimates are in line with, but smaller than, previous estimates in the literature. Implementing piecemeal adjustments produced misleading results.\r\n\r\nImplications: Our results confirm the importance of selection for savings estimates and for provider organizations managing costs and quality. Attribution rules that consider multiple years may help mitigate the impact of beneficiary churn for providers and payers. Implementing payment reform by randomizing early participants, or implementing fully across selected markets, may better serve efforts to evaluate and improve payment models",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We examined the real-world comparative safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) vs. other newer anti-glycemic medications (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors [DPP4i], glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [GLP1a]) in patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Among US Veterans with diabetes receiving care from the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system over 2004-19, we identified incident users of SGLT2i vs. DPP4i vs. GLP1a monotherapy. In analyses stratified by CKD status, defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria, we examined associations of SGLT2i vs. DPP4i vs. GLP1a use with risk of infection-related (primary outcome) and genitourinary infection hospitalizations (secondary outcome) using multivariable Cox models. FINDINGS: Among 92,269 patients who met eligibility criteria, 52% did not have CKD, whereas 48% had CKD. In the overall and non-CKD cohorts, compared to DPP4i use, SGLT2i use was associated with lower infection-related hospitalization risk (HRs [95% CIs] 0.74 [0.67-0.81] and 0.77 [0.67, 0.88], respectively), whereas GLP1a use demonstrated comparable risk. However, in the CKD cohort SGLT2i and GLP1a use were each associated with lower risk (HRs [95% CIs] 0.70 [0.61, 0.81] and 0.91 [0.84, 0.99], respectively). Propensity score-matched analyses showed similar findings in the non-CKD and CKD cohorts. In the overall, non-CKD, and CKD cohorts, SGLT2i use was associated with lower genitourinary infection hospitalization risk whereas GLP1a use showed comparable risk vs. DPP4i use. INTERPRETATION: In a national cohort of Veterans with diabetes, compared with DPP4i use, SGLT2i use was associated with lower infection-related and genitourinary infection hospitalization risk.

Structural characteristics were the most common, collected in all 15 included protocols, 14 examined at least 1 organizational process, and 12 examined organizational-level outcomes. Most studies proposed descriptive practice-level analyses or multilevel analyses using random effects to account for clustering of patients and staff within practices. Few (n = 5) specified that organizational variables would be modeled as effects of interest (vs covaried out) or proposed analytic approaches that could more robustly examine effects of targeted organizational characteristics on primary outcomes.

      "abstract": "Background Electronic health records (EHRs) have yet to fully capture social determinants of health (SDOH) due to challenges such as nonexistent or inconsistent data capture tools across clinics, lack of time, and the burden of extra steps for the clinician. However, patient clinical notes (unstructured data) may be a better source of patient-related SDOH information. Objective It is unclear how accurately EHR data reflect patients’ lived experience of SDOH. The manual process of retrieving SDOH information from clinical notes is time-consuming and not feasible. We leveraged two high-throughput tools to identify SDOH mappings to structured and unstructured patient data: PatientExploreR and Electronic Medical Record Search Engine (EMERSE). Methods We included adult patients (≥18 years of age) receiving primary care for their diabetes at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019. We used expert raters to develop a corpus using SDOH in the compendium as a knowledge base as targets for the natural language processing (NLP) text string mapping to find string stems, roots, and syntactic similarities in the clinical notes of patients with diabetes. We applied advanced built-in EMERSE NLP query parsers implemented with JavaCC. Results We included 4283 adult patients receiving primary care for diabetes at UCSF. Our study revealed that SDOH may be more significant in the lives of patients with diabetes than is evident from structured data recorded on EHRs. With the application of EMERSE NLP rules, we uncovered additional information from patient clinical notes on problems related to social connectionsisolation, employment, financial insecurity, housing insecurity, food insecurity, education, and stress. Conclusions We discovered more patient information related to SDOH in unstructured data than in structured data. The application of this technique and further investment in similar user-friendly tools and infrastructure to extract SDOH information from unstructured data may help to identify the range of social conditions that influence patients’ disease experiences and inform clinical decision-making.",

Findings This cohort study measured and reported the use of 41 individual low-value services and a composite measure of 28 services for 556 health systems serving a total of 11 637 763 Medicare beneficiaries across the US. Systems varied widely in the provision of low-value care; those with a smaller proportion of primary care physicians, without a major teaching hospital, headquartered in the South and West, and serving areas with higher health care spending delivered more low-value care. Meaning This study suggests that claims-based definitions can be used to measure low-value care within systems, providing granular, actionable feedback to promote health care quality and affordability.",

      "abstract": "Introduction : Health technology innovation encompasses many areas, such as medical devices, diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, digital health solutions, telemedicine, health informatics, and more. These innovations aim to enhance healthcare delivery, improve patient outcomes, increase access to services, reduce costs, and advance medical research.\nMethodology : We have analyzed health technology innovations reported between January 2011 and December 2022. Regulatory approval for the innovative products was determined based solely on official open-access websites of health agencies, disregarding information from company websites or third-party sources. The search process utilized identified innovation agencies and sources like Primary Health Care (Innovations were thoroughly examined from these sources, focusing on health technologies, and success was gauged through regulatory approval.\nResults : The WHO Compendium includes 200 health innovations primarily intended for low-resource settings, with the USA accounting for the highest number, followed by India, the only low- and middle-income country (LMIC) with significant innovations. However, 58% of the listed innovations did not obtain regulatory clearance. Medical devices dominated the listed innovations, while scalable assistive technologies were limited. Global innovation agencies, particularly Grand Challenges, supported many innovations, but the regulatory approval rate remained low. In India, BIRAC supported 92% of the mapped innovations, with a similar trend of low regulatory approval rates.\nConclusion: The study observed the highest number of innovations during 2015-2017, with medical devices being the most prominent category. However, most innovations from both global and domestic agencies were unapproved, raising concerns about regulatory clearance for these health technologies.\nManuscript Highlights: The manuscript presents several important highlights concerning health technology innovation and regulatory approval. It highlights the evaluation of health innovations from 2015 to 2022, focusing on their success rate based on health agency approval. It reveals an uneven distribution of innovations from different countries and emphasizes the need for critical interventions to improve the process. This study emphasizes the significance of innovations in achieving healthcare equity and sustainable development goals.",
