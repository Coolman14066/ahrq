# Playwright MCP Server Setup Guide

This guide explains how to use the Playwright Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that has been configured for the AHRQ Dashboard project.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol that allows AI assistants (like Claude) to interact with external tools and services. The Playwright MCP server specifically enables browser automation capabilities, allowing AI to:

- Navigate web pages
- Extract data from websites
- Take screenshots
- Run automated tests
- Generate test code
- Execute JavaScript in browsers

## Installation Status

âœ… **Already Installed!** The Playwright MCP server has been configured for this project:

- Configuration file: `.mcp.json`
- Package: `@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server` (v1.0.6)
- Location: Added to `devDependencies` in `package.json`

## Configuration

The MCP configuration is stored in `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Use with Claude Desktop

1. **For Claude Desktop users**: The `.mcp.json` file will be automatically detected
2. **Restart Claude Desktop** after the configuration is added
3. The Playwright tools will be available in your Claude conversations

## Available Playwright Tools

When using Claude with the Playwright MCP server, you can request the following actions:

### Navigation & Interaction
- `playwright_navigate [url]` - Navigate to a URL
- `playwright_click [selector]` - Click an element
- `playwright_fill [selector] [text]` - Fill in a form field
- `playwright_press [key]` - Press a keyboard key
- `playwright_hover [selector]` - Hover over an element
- `playwright_select [selector] [value]` - Select dropdown option

### Waiting & Synchronization
- `playwright_wait_for_selector [selector]` - Wait for element to appear
- `playwright_wait_for_timeout [ms]` - Wait for specified time
- `playwright_wait_for_download` - Wait for download to complete

### Data Extraction
- `playwright_get_visible_html [selector]` - Get HTML content
- `playwright_evaluate [js_code]` - Execute JavaScript and return result
- `playwright_screenshot [filename]` - Take a screenshot

### Configuration
- `playwright_set_viewport [width] [height]` - Set browser viewport size

## Use Cases for AHRQ Dashboard

### 1. Automated Testing
Test the AHRQ Dashboard components:

```javascript
// Example: Test dashboard loading
playwright_navigate http://localhost:5173
playwright_wait_for_selector .dashboard-loaded
playwright_screenshot dashboard-test.png
```

### 2. Data Collection
Enhance existing data collection scripts:

```javascript
// Example: Scrape AHRQ compendium updates
playwright_navigate https://ahrq.gov/compendium
playwright_get_visible_html .compendium-list
playwright_evaluate () => document.querySelectorAll('.citation').length
```

### 3. Visual Regression Testing
Capture screenshots for visual comparisons:

```javascript
// Example: Capture all visualizations
playwright_navigate http://localhost:5173
playwright_wait_for_selector .recharts-wrapper
playwright_screenshot charts.png
playwright_wait_for_selector .network-graph
playwright_screenshot network.png
```

### 4. Performance Testing
Measure page load times and performance:

```javascript
// Example: Measure load performance
playwright_navigate http://localhost:5173
playwright_evaluate () => performance.timing.loadEventEnd - performance.timing.navigationStart
```

## Example Test Scripts

We've created example test scripts in the `playwright-tests/` directory:

1. **dashboard-test.example.js** - Test scenarios for the AHRQ Dashboard
2. **data-scraping.example.js** - Web scraping examples for research data
3. **integration-example.js** - Integration with existing AHRQ scripts

## Integration with Existing Scripts

The Playwright MCP server can enhance your existing Python data collection scripts:

```python
# Example: Enhance scopus_search_details.py
import subprocess
import json

def scrape_with_playwright(url):
    commands = [
        f'playwright_navigate {url}',
        'playwright_wait_for_selector .results',
        'playwright_get_visible_html .results'
    ]
    # Execute through MCP server
    result = subprocess.run(['npx', '@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server'] + commands)
    return result.stdout
```

## Running Tests

To use Playwright MCP for testing:

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In Claude Desktop, request Playwright actions:
   ```
   "Please test the dashboard by navigating to http://localhost:5173 and taking screenshots of all major components"
   ```

3. Claude will execute the Playwright commands through the MCP server

## Best Practices

1. **Wait for Elements**: Always wait for elements before interacting:
   ```javascript
   playwright_wait_for_selector .element
   playwright_click .element
   ```

2. **Handle Dynamic Content**: Use appropriate waits for JavaScript-rendered content:
   ```javascript
   playwright_wait_for_selector .dynamic-content
   playwright_wait_for_timeout 1000  // Additional wait if needed
   ```

3. **Error Handling**: Request Claude to verify elements exist before interaction:
   ```javascript
   playwright_evaluate document.querySelector('.element') !== null
   ```

4. **Screenshots for Debugging**: Take screenshots at key points:
   ```javascript
   playwright_screenshot before-action.png
   playwright_click .button
   playwright_screenshot after-action.png
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Available
- Ensure Claude Desktop is restarted after configuration
- Check that `.mcp.json` is in the project root
- Verify the package is installed: `npm list @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server`

### Commands Not Working
- Ensure your local development server is running for local URLs
- Check selectors are correct and elements exist
- Use `playwright_wait_for_selector` before interactions

### Performance Issues
- Limit the number of screenshots in automated workflows
- Use `playwright_set_viewport` to test specific screen sizes
- Close browser sessions when done with testing

## Advanced Usage

### Continuous Monitoring
Set up automated monitoring of AHRQ resources:

```javascript
// Daily check for compendium updates
playwright_navigate https://ahrq.gov/compendium
playwright_evaluate () => document.querySelector('.last-updated')?.textContent
// Compare with stored value to detect changes
```

### Automated Report Generation
Generate visual reports of dashboard state:

```javascript
// Capture all views
const views = ['overview', 'trends', 'network', 'gaps'];
for (const view of views) {
  playwright_navigate `http://localhost:5173#${view}`
  playwright_wait_for_selector `.${view}-loaded`
  playwright_screenshot `report-${view}.png`
}
```

## Security Considerations

- Never use Playwright MCP to enter sensitive credentials
- Be cautious when scraping external websites (respect robots.txt)
- Use environment variables for any authentication needs
- Limit access to production systems

## Next Steps

1. Explore the example test files in `playwright-tests/`
2. Try running Playwright commands through Claude Desktop
3. Integrate Playwright MCP with your existing data collection workflows
4. Create custom test scenarios for your specific needs
