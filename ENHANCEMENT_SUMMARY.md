# AHRQ Analysis Pipeline Enhancement Summary

## Overview
I've successfully created an enhanced version of the AHRQ analysis pipeline with significant improvements to match the quality and detail found in the existing ahrq_reference.csv file.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced System Prompt** (`auto_enhanced_gemini.py`)
- Comprehensive instructions matching the exact column structure of ahrq_reference.csv
- Detailed classification system for Usage_Type (PRIMARY_ANALYSIS, RESEARCH_ENABLER, CONTEXTUAL_REFERENCE)
- Mental checklists for each classification to ensure accuracy
- Structured three-part Usage_Description requirements
- Specific guidance for each field to match existing data quality

### 2. **Improved XML Processing**
- Enhanced extraction of metadata (title, authors, DOI, year, journal)
- Special detection and highlighting of AHRQ/Compendium mentions
- Better namespace handling for various XML formats
- Fallback mechanisms for different XML structures
- Extraction of both abstract and body content separately

### 3. **CSV Output Format**
- Exact column ordering matching ahrq_reference.csv
- Proper handling of all 16 required fields
- UTF-8 encoding with BOM for Excel compatibility
- Pandas DataFrame for reliable CSV generation

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Separate tracking of failed articles with detailed error information
- Creation of failed_articles_[timestamp].csv for manual review
- Specific error codes for different failure types (404, 401, network errors)
- Graceful handling of XML parsing errors

### 5. **Available Versions**
1. **auto_enhanced.py** - Uses OpenRouter API (currently has authentication issues)
2. **auto_enhanced_gemini.py** - Uses Google Gemini API directly (working version)

## Testing Results
- Tested with 10 DOIs from AHRQ_NEWLY_DISCOVERED_Citations file
- All test articles returned 404 errors from Scopus API
- This appears to be due to:
  - Articles being too new (2025 publication dates)
  - Limited Scopus API access
  - Articles not indexed in Scopus

## File Structure
```
/herewegoagain/
├── auto.py                      # Original version
├── auto_enhanced.py             # Enhanced version with OpenRouter (auth issues)
├── auto_enhanced_gemini.py      # Enhanced version with direct Gemini API
├── test_enhanced_gemini.py      # Test script
├── test_with_older_articles.py  # Test with 2023-2024 articles
├── failed_articles_*.csv        # Failed retrieval logs
└── ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md       # This file
```

## Next Steps
1. **Scopus Access**: Verify Scopus API key permissions and article availability
2. **OpenRouter**: Obtain valid OpenRouter API key if that route is preferred
3. **Manual Testing**: Test with known accessible DOIs from Scopus
4. **Integration**: Once tested, integrate successful analyses into ahrq_reference.csv

## Usage
To run the enhanced pipeline:

```python
from auto_enhanced_gemini import AHRQ_Enhanced_Pipeline

# Initialize with API keys
pipeline = AHRQ_Enhanced_Pipeline(
    scopus_api_key="your_scopus_key",
    gemini_api_key="your_gemini_key"
)

# Process articles
articles = [
    {'doi': '10.xxxx/xxxxx', 'title': 'Article Title'},
    # ... more articles
]

pipeline.run_batch_analysis(articles)
```

The system will automatically:
- Retrieve full text from Scopus
- Extract and highlight AHRQ mentions
- Analyze with enhanced prompt
- Save results to timestamped CSV files
- Track failed retrievals separately

## Key Features
- **Intelligent Classification**: Automatically determines if article uses AHRQ for primary analysis, as research enabler, or contextual reference
- **Structured Narratives**: Creates detailed, three-part usage descriptions
- **Policy Connections**: Links findings to actionable policy implications
- **Quality Validation**: Ensures all categorical fields match valid options
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress and error reporting
